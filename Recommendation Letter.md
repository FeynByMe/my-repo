To the Erasmus Admission Office at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica,

I am writing this recommendation at the request of Henrique Sousa de Brito, who is applying for an Erasmus Mundus Category A scholarship.

I have known Henrique academically, in my capacity as Teaching Assistant at Nova School of Business and Economics for the course Linear Algebra with Programming during the Fall semester of 2022/2023. During this brief period, Henrique showed effective learning skills and a clear capacity to balance his academic and athletic endeavours. His performance in high-school was above average, having scored highly in his two most important national exams: Mathematics and Economics.

From conversations with him, I became aware of his interests and passions outside university. Henrique is quite devout to his athletic life, and he's currently training hard to compete in higher level Boxing tournaments – a sport known to test mental endurance. This became reflected via the commitment and discipline he exhibited throughout the semester. Beyond the world of sports, Henrique told me about his drive to become more involved with his community when he decided to join Banco Alimentar, during his high-school tenure – Banco Alimentar is a famous Portuguese NGO that aims to aid under-served people and communities by facilitating them access to food items and essential groceries. 

Henrique has also exhibited a strong entrepreneurial trait. He has always maintained, either through his International Summer Internship in Madrid at FEU VERT or his period working the cash register at a local burger place, a clear desire to learn more about the “real” world, and about how things work. This is an essential skill for someone pursuing a successful career in management, a skill which could be sharpened by an intensive 6-month Erasmus stint at a thriving business and academic environment, like the one he would find at PUC.

On a more personal level, Henrique told me in conversation that, beyond the academic challenge, he was looking at this as an opportunity to meet new people, to learn a new culture and figure out how to manage life far and away from his home, family, and friends. His mindset of “growth stems from challenge and uncomfort", should, I believe, be rewarded by being admitted to this program.

Bearing in mind all previously mentioned, I would strongly recommend  Henrique Sousa de Brito for a scholarship that will enable him to continue  his education in Brazil, at PUC. If my understanding of Henrique's potential is in any way accurate, he will be an excellent addition to your University.

Sincerely yours,

Diogo Freire de Andrade,

Teaching Assistant at Nova School of Business and Economics
